# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project

**dependably** is a self-hosted private artifact repository for npm, PyPI, and NuGet. Core design priorities: supply chain awareness (first-fetch tracking, checksum verification, SBOM generation) and multitenancy (org isolation, scoped tokens, BOLA protection).

Tech stack: **ASP.NET Core 9 / C#**, **Dapper** (parameterized SQL only — no string interpolation), **SQLite** (`IMetadataStore` / `SqliteMetadataStore`), **Serilog** structured JSON logging, **JWT** sessions, **BCrypt** passwords, **NuGet.Versioning** for NuGet version normalization.

## Deploy

```bash
# Build and start (ARM64 / Raspberry Pi)
docker compose up -d --build

# Rebuild after code changes
docker compose up -d --build

# View logs
docker compose logs -f

# Stop
docker compose down
```

## Commands

```bash
# Build
dotnet build

# Run all unit/compliance/security tests
dotnet test --filter "Category!=Integration"

# Run a single test class
dotnet test --filter "ClassName=PurlNormalizerTests"

# Run all tests including integration (self-contained — uses in-memory blob + SQLite stores)
dotnet test

# Run the server locally (defaults to local blob store at /data)
dotnet run --project src/Dependably

# Build release binary
dotnet publish src/Dependably -c Release -r linux-musl-x64 --self-contained true /p:PublishSingleFile=true
```

## Key architectural rules

- **BlobKeys is the only place blob keys are constructed.** Callers never build key strings inline.
- **All Dapper queries must use parameterized form.** No string interpolation inside SQL calls — enforced by CI Roslyn analyzer.
- **SQL touching tenant-scoped tables must filter on `org_id`/`tenant_id`** — enforced by the `OrgIdFilteringComplianceTests` test. Legitimately cross-tenant queries (one-shot migrations, system-admin views, queries keyed by an FK-bound id that's already org-scoped) opt out with a `// xtenant: <reason>` comment in the 5 lines above the SQL literal.
- **Comments describe the current architecture, not its development history.** No issue/tracker numbers (`#123`), milestone tags (`M2.1`), or ephemeral branch/PR pointers (`this PR`, `see plan §2`, `pre-#91`, `used to…`) in code or config comments — that provenance belongs in git history and the issue tracker, not the source. Write present-tense descriptions of how the code behaves now. (Functional markers such as the `// xtenant:` opt-out above and `// deepcode ignore` suppressions are not provenance and are fine.)
- **`IBlobStore` never makes naming decisions** — keys always come from `BlobKeys`.
- **`IMetadataStore` returns raw connections.** Callers use Dapper extension methods and are responsible for `await using`.
- **PURLs are the canonical package identity.** `PurlNormalizer` is the single source of truth — used by push handlers, proxy handlers, simple index generator, and npm metadata rewriter.
- Org routes: `/o/{org}/simple/`, `/o/{org}/npm/`, `/o/{org}/nuget/`. Short aliases `/simple/`, `/npm/`, `/nuget/` redirect to the default org.
- **Token auth**: npm uses `Authorization: Bearer <token>`; PyPI and NuGet use `Authorization: Basic base64(user:<token>)`. Resolution in `TokenAuthExtensions.ResolveTokenAsync`. Token stored as SHA-256 hash in DB.
- **NuGet push** uses `X-NuGet-ApiKey` header, not Authorization.
- **Proxy cache miss** path: check `BlobKeys.Proxy(sha256)` in blob store → if absent, fetch from upstream, verify checksum, store, serve. Configured via `PyPI:Upstream`, `Npm:Upstream`, `NuGet:Upstream` settings.
- **Upload size limits**: checked in order — org ecosystem limit → org global limit → instance ecosystem limit. Returned as 413 before any blob is written.
- **OpenAPI is split into two named documents.** Management endpoints (`/api/v1/…`) are documented at `/api/v1/docs/` (spec: `/openapi/management.json`); protocol surfaces (`/v2/`, `/simple/`, `/npm/`, `/nuget/v3/`, …) are documented at `/docs/` (spec: `/openapi/protocol.json`). The split is route-prefix-driven (via `OpenApiOptions.ShouldInclude` against `ApiDescription.RelativePath`), not attribute-driven — new controllers land in the right document automatically based on where they route.
- **Protocol surfaces follow upstream ecosystem specifications, not Dependably API versioning.** OCI is at `/v2/` because the Distribution Spec mandates it; PyPI is at `/simple/` because PEP 503 mandates it; npm and NuGet are at the paths their clients hardcode. Do not add internal version segments to these routes.
- **AI code review runs in CI as an advisory `ai-review` stage.** Four MR-only jobs (`ai-review-security`, `-code`, `-architecture`, `-docs`) send the MR diff to a local Ollama model and post per-lens findings as merge-request comments (plus a job-log section and a Markdown artifact). Logic lives in `ci/ai-review.sh`, per-lens prompts in `ci/prompts/`; jobs are `allow_failure: true` and never gate a release. Configuration and the `AI_REVIEW_GITLAB_TOKEN` secret are documented in `CONTRIBUTING.md` → "AI code review (CI)".

## Environment variables

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `DB_PATH` | `/data/dependably.db` | SQLite database file path |
| `STORAGE_BACKEND` | `local` | `local`, `s3`, or `azure` — default for both storage tiers |
| `STORAGE_BACKEND_CACHE` / `STORAGE_BACKEND_REGISTRY` | inherits | #57 per-tier override. Cache holds proxy artefacts (eviction-friendly); registry holds published artefacts (durable, never auto-evicted). |
| `LOCAL_STORAGE_PATH` | `/data/blobs` | Root for local blob store |
| `LOCAL_STORAGE_PATH_CACHE` / `LOCAL_STORAGE_PATH_REGISTRY` | inherits | Per-tier path override (use to keep tiers on separate volumes) |
| `S3_BUCKET` / `S3_REGION` | — | Required for S3 backend; suffixed `_CACHE` / `_REGISTRY` for per-tier |
| `AZURE_CONNECTION_STRING` / `AZURE_CONTAINER` | — | Required for Azure backend; suffixed `_CACHE` / `_REGISTRY` for per-tier |
| `DEFAULT_ORG_SLUG` | `default` | Slug of the default org created on first boot |
| `MAX_UPLOAD_BYTES` | — | Instance-wide upload size limit |
| `MAX_UPLOAD_BYTES_PYPI/NPM/NUGET` | — | Per-ecosystem upload size limits |
| `BASE_URL` | derived from request | Public base URL for tarball rewriting and NuGet service index |
| `TRUSTED_PROXIES` | — (trust all forwarders) | Comma-separated IPs/CIDRs allowed to set `X-Forwarded-For`/`-Proto` (e.g. `10.0.0.0/8,172.18.0.1`). When unset, forwarded headers are accepted from any client (back-compat) and a startup warning is logged — set this to your reverse proxy's address(es) so source IP (used by the `/metrics` allowlist, rate-limit keys, audit `source_ip`) can't be spoofed. |
| `PyPI:Upstream` | `https://pypi.org` | Upstream PyPI registry |
| `Npm:Upstream` | `https://registry.npmjs.org` | Upstream npm registry |
| `NuGet:Upstream` | `https://api.nuget.org/v3` | Upstream NuGet registry |
| `Maven:Upstream` | `https://repo1.maven.org/maven2` | Upstream Maven registry (Maven Central). `Maven:NegativeCacheTtl`, `Maven:VerifyWithUpstreamSha256` tune the proxy. |
| `Rpm:Upstream` | — (no default URL) | Upstream RPM repo base URL. Proxy passthrough is governed by the per-org `ProxyPassthroughEnabled` (default **on**), same as every ecosystem — RPM is **not** disabled by default. The only difference: RPM ships with **no default upstream URL** (PyPI/npm/NuGet/Maven have hardcoded defaults) because RPM repos are distro/release-specific, so set this to point RPM at a mirror. `Rpm:UpstreamMode` (`passthrough`) selects behaviour. Signature verification is opt-in via `Rpm:GpgKey`. |
| `Rpm:GpgKey` | — (verification off) | Operator-pinned trust anchor for the RPM proxy: an inline ASCII-armored OpenPGP public key block, or a file path / `file:` URL the operator trusts out of band. When set, the proxy verifies `repomd.xml`'s detached signature (`repomd.xml.asc`) before trusting upstream metadata; on failure it refuses to resolve (fail closed). When unset, verification is skipped (back-compat) and a startup warning is logged. The anchor must be operator-provided — the upstream-fetched GPG key is not used as the trust root (circular against a MITM). |
| `Rpm:VerifyRepomdSignature` | derived | Force signature verification on/off. When unset, verification is enabled iff `Rpm:GpgKey` is set. Setting `true` with no parseable key fails every resolution closed. |
| `Oci:Upstreams` | Docker Hub (`registry-1.docker.io`) | Array of upstream OCI registries (prefix-routed, per-registry auth). Configured in `appsettings.json` under `Oci:Upstreams`, not a flat env var. |
| `PROXY_STAGING_PATH` | `Path.GetTempPath()` | #104 hash-and-stage staging dir for proxy-fetch MISS path. Container deployments expecting large artefacts should set this to a disk-backed volume (e.g. `/data/staging`) — `/tmp` is often tmpfs (RAM-backed), which defeats the memory-bounding goal. |
| `VULN_SCAN_SCHEDULE` | `0 4 * * *` | Cron schedule for vulnerability scan + rescan passes |
| `VULN_SCAN_JITTER_SECONDS` | `3600` | Random offset (0..N seconds) added to each scheduled scan to avoid thundering-herd against OSV. Set `0` to disable. |
| `VULN_RESCAN_AGE_HOURS` | `24` | Re-check already-scanned proxy versions whose `vuln_checked_at` is older than this |
| `VULN_SCAN_BATCH_DELAY_MS` | `500` | Delay between OSV /querybatch calls during scan/rescan |
